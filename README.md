# APPNet（code for An Adaptive Post-Processing Network With Global-Local Aggregation For semantic segmentation）
**The code is being sorted and will be uploaded later.**
## Introduction
  In this paper, we propose an adaptive post-processing network (APPNet) for semantic segmentation based on the predictions of current methods in the global image and local image patches. The key point of APPNet is the global-local aggregation module, which models the context between global
predictions and local predictions to generate accurate pixel-wise representation. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive points
replacement module to compensate for the lack of fine detail in global prediction and the overconfidence in local predictions.

## Results
Our method can be readily integrated into existing segmentation methods (i.e., ConvNeXt, HRNet, ViT-Adapter) with little memory and without extra modification in current models. We empirically demonstrate our method brings performance improvements across diverse datasets (i.e., Cityscapes, ADE20K, PASCAL-Context, COCO-Stuff).
